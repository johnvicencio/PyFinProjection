This program is designed to create a financial statement in Excel for a company, using Python. The program calculates monthly financial figures based on fixed and variable expenses, applying seasonal adjustments where necessary. It then exports this data into an Excel file, complete with formatting and titles.

### How the Program Works

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program begins by setting up a DataFrame in pandas. This DataFrame includes columns for different financial categories, items, the months of the year, a "Total" column, and a "Rate" column.
   - Basic information like the company name, subtitle, and projected revenue is defined early on.

2. **Handling Expenses:**
   - The program handles both fixed and variable expenses. Fixed expenses are spread evenly across all months. Variable expenses, however, are adjusted for each month according to predefined seasonal rates.
   - A list of fixed expense items is provided, and the program treats these differently from variable expenses by not applying seasonal adjustments.

3. **Row Creation:**
   - The program generates rows for each item using a function that considers whether the item is a fixed or variable expense. For fixed items, the expense is divided equally across the year. For variable items, each month's expense is adjusted based on the season.
   - Rows are grouped under categories such as "REVENUE / SALES", "COGS", and "STORE EXPENSES", with blank rows added for better organization.

4. **Seasonal Adjustments:**
   - Seasonal rates for each month are used to adjust variable expenses. These adjustments reflect expected changes in expenses across the year, such as higher costs during busier months.

5. **Exporting to Excel:**
   - Once the DataFrame is complete, the program exports it to an Excel file. After saving the initial file, it reopens it using openpyxl to make further adjustments.
   - The program adjusts column widths, adds the company name and subtitle at the top, and formats certain text to make the document more presentable. It also ensures that the "Rate" column is formatted as a percentage and that monetary values are displayed with two decimal places.
   - Rows with specific terms like "Net Sales" or "Total" are highlighted in bold for emphasis.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The finished Excel file is saved with all the applied formatting. This file can then be used for financial analysis or as part of a presentation.

### How to Run the Program

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Install the necessary libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
     ```
     pip install pandas openpyxl
     ```

2. **Running the Program:**
   - Save the provided code in a file named `pyfinprojection.py`.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `pyfinprojection.py` is located.
   - Run the program by entering the following command:
     ```
     python pyfinprojection.py
     ```
   - The program will execute, generating a financial projection statement and saving it as `financial_statement.xlsx` in the same directory.

3. **Opening the Output File:**
   - After running the program, locate the `financial_statement.xlsx` file in your directory.
   - Double-click on the file to open it using Excel or any compatible spreadsheet software.
   - The file will contain a formatted financial projection statement based on the data and calculations performed by the program.

By following these steps, you will be able to run the `pyfinprojection.py` script and view the financial projection statement it generates.

### Summary

This program efficiently generates a financial projection statement, incorporating seasonal adjustments and ensuring that the final output is both accurate and professionally formatted. Itâ€™s a helpful tool for companies needing to create detailed financial projections.
